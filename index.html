      <h1>💖 My Love Letter 💖</h1>
      <p>
        My dearest Diyu,<br><br>
        I still remember the day I saw you for the first time – since then, everything changed. Your smile, your voice, your presence became my reason to smile. Through thick and thin, you've always been the calm in my storm. I cherish every memory with you – from class 8 giggles to board exam prayers, to those magical nicknames we share. You’re not just my crush anymore, you are my dream, my home, my always.<br><br>
        With all my heart, I promise to stand by you, hold your hand through every season, and love you endlessly. 💍 Will you be my forever?<br><br>
        Yours eternally,<br>
        Oreo (Your Baccha)
