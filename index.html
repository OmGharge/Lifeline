      <h1>💖 My Love Letter 💖</h1>
      <p>
        My dearest Diyu,<br><br>
        🌸 To My Diyu, My Princess, My Mumma, My Everything 🌸
From the first time we met, destiny had already begun writing the most beautiful story I could ever be part of. We’ve crossed oceans of time, changed paths, grown apart and come back stronger — and all this while, something deep within me always whispered your name.

You are the softness in my chaos, the light in my dark days, the pastel hue in my black and white world. You aren’t just my best friend… you’re my heartbeat, my comfort, my reason to smile even on the dullest days.

Diyu, the way you scold me with love, protect me like a lioness, call me Baccha, Pillu, Oru, and light up at the smallest things — it’s all etched in my soul. You’re my safe place, my home, my person.

You have filled every void in me with your care. You’ve loved me when I didn’t even know how to love myself. And that’s why, today, with all my heart, I ask...

Will you be mine forever, Diyu? 💍
Will you let me be your forever Pillu?<br>
        Oreo (Your Baccha)
